# Decision Log

## QuickBooks Cash Flow Type Logic  
- In the `int_quickbooks__cash_flow_classifications` model, our default behavior is to classify the `cash_flow_type` based on the `account_type`, `account_class` or `account_name` fields of the balance sheet line. This logic was based on best available financial practices, with the cash flow being calculated using the indirect method rather than the direct method. Cash flow types usually fall into one of four buckets:
    - Operating: A measure of the amount of cash generated by a company's business operations. Account types like current assets & liabilities, accounts receivable & payable, credit card as well as account names like net income adjustment were assigned here by our default logic. 
    - Investing: Any inflows or outflows of cash from a company's long-term investments. Account types like fixed and other assets end up here by default. 
    - Financing: The movement of cash between a firm and its owners, investors, and creditors. Account types like long term liability and account classes like equity fall here under our logic.
    - Cash or Cash Equivalents: Line items that report value of a company's cash assets. Bank account types are assigned here. 

- While the default case statement logic should work for many customers with basic setups, as customization gets more advanced for your specific business, this is not likely to cover all cases. This is why we created the seed functionality to allow you flexibility to adjust the cash flow types for your own custom purposes--[you can read more about how to set it up in our README](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_quickbooks/blob/main/README.md#customize-the-cash-flow-model).

## QuickBooks Financial Statement Ordinal Logic

- In the `int_quickbooks__cash_flow_classifications` and `quickbooks__general_ledger_by_period` models, we developed custom logic for ordering your financial models based on best known practices. In general, financial accounting statements have specific ordering that we've tried to preserve for balance sheets, profit and loss statements, and cash flow statements.
    - For the `quickbooks__balance_sheet` model, we order based on `account_class`: Asset, Liability, then Equity, in that order.
    - For the `quickbooks__profit_and_loss` model, we order based on `account_class`: Revenue, then Expense, in that order.
    - For the `quickbooks__cash_flow_statement` model, we order based on `cash_flow_type`: Operating, Investing, Financing, then Cash or Cash Equivalents, in that order.
